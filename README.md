ChiCLI v1.R2 (c) 2021 Chiron Bramberger

A Commodore 64 command line interface terminal, similar to and inspired by: AmigaDOS, Commodore DOS, MS-DOS, and Linux.

ChiCLI - Features List:

- Engage your Commodore 64 using a terminal or command line interface familiar to modern computers.
- Get a system informational overview of your Commodore 64 at startup.
- View and manage files and floppies on any drive: type, run, rename, copy, delete, format, validate, and initialize.
- Copy all files within a folder or disk to another device using the * wildcard. Use this to extract an entire disk image to a folder or floppy disk on supported device.
- Change drive device number of 1541 drives and SD2IEC devices.
- Advanced file management on supported devices: make directory, remove directory, rename directories, mount disk images, extract files from disk images and copy them to a folder on the same device, view and access partitions, and detect device type.
- View date and time on SD2IEC, view file date and time stamps, set the time and date on RTC supported devices. Show the time and if wanted date on a built-in screen saver.
- Change and save settings on an SD2IEC, such as device number and whether to hide or show file extensions.
- View memory, peek and poke memory, repeatedly peek at memory, and save memory ranges as a file. Can be used to dump your Commodore 64 kernal ROM to a file.
- Execute "sys" or other dos commands easily.
- The Turbo Macro Pro shortcut and be used with the built-in "run" command and it's "-t" option to load and execute Turbo Macro Pro quickly and easily. For example just type: "run tmp -t".
- Show key codes for keys and combinations of key presses on the keyboard.
- Do basic maths and convert numbers to other format like decimal, hex and binary numbers.
- Use a simple stopwatch using the command line or hot key F5.
- Create custom shortcuts using aliases and hotkeys.
- Change color profiles or set your own custom color scheme.
- Use the built-in alias "help" to view the included manual which contains an overview of all the commands and features.

Latest News:
v1.R2 - Release Candidate 2 - Dec 1 2021
- Optimized: *PACKS -EVEN MORE- IN A SINGLE APPLICATION!* Even more optimizations!
- Added:     Support for reading RTC from an RTC upgraded SD2IEC!!!
- Added:     Support for setting RTC.
- Added:     The filedate command, which allows you to view the time stamp of a given file name.
- Updated:   The datetime command uses the RTC from the SD2IEC exculsively, even if it doesn't have an RTC, as the SD2IEC uses a software clock instead.
- Updated:   The datetime command is seprate from the separate date and time commands.
- Updated:   Screensaver to use RTC time. Wasn't needed - Worked automatically!
- Updated:   Make logo show nothing instead of time if thereâ€™s no SD2IEC.
- Updated:   Support for checking if RTC exists. If it doesn't in any way, everything is handled graciously.
- Added:     A list-partitions command, which shows the names adn letters of available partitions on the device.
- Updated:   You can use the cd command to change drives and partitons!
- Updated:   Abilty to abort a multi-file copy by pressing CTRL-C or RUNSTOP.
- Updated:   Abilty to abort a multi-file delete by pressing CTRL-C or RUNSTOP.
- Added:     Created dump-mem command which let's you save a file of memory.
- Updated:   The dump-mem command has shortcuts so it's easy to dump your BASIC or kernal ROMs.
- Updated:   Change all uiec references to SD2IEC.
- Fixed:     Surpressed crap characters from showing when using run without arguments.
- Fixed:     Change sys-info to sysinfo to fit my Amiga muscle memory.
- Fixed:     Don't do general emulation detection, just VICE and TheC64/Mini. This fixes a false positive emulation detection on real hardware.
- Fixed:     Properly detect the SX-64 using either of it's two stock kernals, or the JiffyDOS kernal.
- Fixed:     When loading JiffyDOS, it shows as a R3 kernal, but then, there was nothing showing for OS. Now it shows JiffyDOS text for OS.
- Fixed:     Detects when JiffyDOS is installed for both regular and SX Commodore 64's!
- Optimized: Saved 53 bytes! --> Remove Header text from BASIC display and all of footer to save RAM.
- Optimized: Saved 5,358 bytes!!! --> Removed current cc65 date and time code and time includes. Huge savings!!!

v1.RC - Release Candidate 1 - Oct 25 2021
- Added:     A brand new stylized rainbow 64 logo!
- Updated:   The startup and "sysinfo" command screen now has more room for detected hardware.
- Updated:   The hardware detection now identifies the earliest C64's.
- Updated:   Made the drive detection faster, so starting up the program is faster.
- Added:     Option to the "run" command "-t" which automatically loads and runs Turbo Macro Pro.
- Updated:   The command "run" automatically loads program into memory using ",1".
- Updated:   Added the list of colors and profiles to the help file instead of built into the program. This saves memory.
- Updated:   The "profile-set" and "color-set" so they take their options on the command line instead of asking questions. This saves memory. 

v0.23 - Aug 28 2021
- Optimized: *PACKS MORE IN A SINGLE APPLICATION!* The previous version was already completely filling up memory. Every new feature required saving as many bytes as possible. As a result, much of the program is optimized for space and often faster as well!
- Added:     *DETECTS EMULATORS!* The "sysinfo" can now detect if the machine is running on actual Commodore hardware, or under emulation! It is listed like this: "Model: TheC64   C64" or "Model: VICE Emu C64" or "Model: VICE Emu CSX-64" or "Model: Emulated C64"
- Updated:   *QUICK FORMAT* The "format" command now supports the Commodore DOS ability to do a quick format, instead of a full format. Use format -q diskname to quick format a disk calling it diskname.
- Updated:   *AUTO-COMPLETE IS WAY FASTER!* I tested it in a long directory, and it went from 70 seconds, to about 3.5 - around 1750% faster!
- Updated:   *TWO-COLUMN LIST!* The "list" command now has a shortened two column mode. This fits more files on the screen at the same time!
- Added:     *EXTRACT D64 IMAGES!* Extract files on a single SD2IEC device and single SD card! Major new functionality to the "copy" command to support copying files from one partition to another within a given device. This lets you mount a D64 disk image on one partition, and extract the files to a folder on another partition. Example: "copy * d09b:" copies all the files in the current partition to the second partition.
- Added:     A new command called "pwd" to show the current device number and partition letter.
- Added:     A command called "partition" to quickly switch the current partition on a device. Example: "partition a" or "part b" or part 0" to switch to a default partition when drives don't support partitions.
- Added:     Commands and support for partitions. There are 9 partitions supported, as letters: "a" through "i". The command "d09a:" changes to the first partition on device 9, "d09b:" to the second. Partition 0 is a special setting that's needed for drives that don't support partitions like the 1541. 
- Added:     New "stopwatch" command that starts when you run it, and when run again, stops and outputs the elapsed seconds since it was last called. It resets on the second call as well. The maximum time is about 18 mins.
- Added:     New maths command called "=" which lets you do very simple 2-term integer calculations. Examples: "= 2 + 2" "= 2 - 2" "= 4 * 4" "= 8 / 2"
- Added:     Command "dec2bin" to convert from decimal to binary. Use "dec2bin 124" to get BIN:01111100
- Added:     Commands "hex2dec" and "dec2hex" to convert numbers between decimal and hexidecial. Use it like this: hex2dec 8000 and get this: HEX:8000 DEC:32768. Use dec2hex 32768 to get DEC:32768 HEX:8000.
- Added:     New "poke-bit" command to make it easier to change just a single bit in memory. Example: poke-bit 1024 1 0 would set the second least significant bit of memory location 1024 to 0.
- Added:     New "peek-bit" command to make it easier to get the value of a single bit in memory. Example: peek-bit 1024 1 outputs the value of the second least significant bit at decimal memory location 1024. 
- Added:     New "peeking" command for constantly reading memory and displaying the output. This is good for watching a constantly changing memory location, like the userport or paddle input.
- Updated:   The "peek" and "poke" commands now also display the value in binary.
- Updated:   The "view-mem" command now does ranges, or defaults to moving forward indefinitly. It also lets you press CURSOR-UP to go back a page.
- Updated:   The "format" command so that just typing "format" alone will use the file name "untitled" by default. Also, "format diskname" without an ID, will default to "0".
- Updated:   The "hotkey" command when removing a defined alias is done like this: "hotkey do-it -clear"
- Updated:   The "alias" command when removing a defined alias is done like this: "alias do-it -clear" 
- Updated:   The command "uiec-save" from "uiec-save-cfg" removing redundant text.
- Updated:   The command hotkeys how shows the PETSCII code in addition to the decimal and hexidecimal. This might change or break the layout temporarily if the PETSCII is for changing colours or cursor position.
- Updated:   The command to run Commodore DOS commands is now just "dos".
- Updated:   Combined version, about, and licence into one command showing all that information at once.
- Updated:   Updated "datetime -set" so that it reminds you to put set the hour in 24-hour format. For example 1:00 PM is 13.
- Updated:   Added "Ready!" to the opening prompt.
- Updated:   Restored a hotkey for listing directories using F3.
- Updated:   When you type help, it automatically tries to type chicli-readme instead of telling you to do that.
- Updated:   Have added additonal testing of other drives using the VICE emulator to my testing routine. And by routine I mean stuff I remeber to try and see if it looks borked.
- Updated:   The status text for the Commdoore 1581 drive returns: "COPYRIGHT CBM DOS V10 1581" which doesn't match the 1541, 1570, or 1571 drive text. I'm finding and replacing this text with "CBM DOS V10 1581". Anyone who wants to see the original text can use 'dos-command' to manually spit it out. 
- Updated:   The start-up screen uses leading zeros for D08: and D09: to align the text better. The program was also updated to support using d8: or d08: and d9: or d09: where that applies.
- Updated:   Auto-complete uses CTRL+LEFT-ARROW and LEFT-ARROW emits the left-arrow character. This is more inituitive and user friendly.
- Restored:  Undocumented commands time, drive-detect, detect-filetype and display_logo, chirp, etc...
- Fixed:     The new fast auto-complete feature had a bug where it would return the disk or folder label depending on the situation.
- Fixed:     A bug in the command "list" where if you used RUN/STOP or CTRL+C to stop a listing, the top-most line displaying a file name would be scrolled up off the screen. So you might miss it. Instead, it now doesn't do that, and the prmopt replaces the text saying to hit any key to continue.
- Fixed:     A bug in the command "alias" where, for example, if you made an alias like this: " alias $ "list -s" ", and then made another like this: " alias $ list ", then there would be two alias created with the same name. Now it updates the existing alias with the new replacement text as one would expect it to.
- Fixed:     A bug in the command "view-mem" where things got wonky after the first screen. Also a bunch of other fixes.
- Fixed:     So many little fixes I can't remember them all! The alias and hotkey functionality is much improved and more consistent.
- Fixed:     A bug in displaying larger files using the "list" command. It now displays the file sizes correctly in kilobytes. The maximum filesize reported is about 16000 KB but on the SD2IEC the files are still the correct size as stored on the SD card.
- Fixed:     GitHub Issue #1: https://github.com/chironb/ChiCLI/issues/1 - Long strings sent from the drive would break the layout of the opening screen. This is better now! It cuts off anything that's too long. 

v0.18 - Dec 15 2020 17:33:55
- Updated:   Command type has the added option -text to force it display the file as if it were a text file. Now type can auto-detect the filetype and display it accordingly, or it can be put into -hex mode or -text mode. 
- Added:     A new shortcut alias rn for rename, and a new shortcut cler for clear. This is because if you type fast on a Commodore keyboard, certain key combinations tend to get lost, because the keyboard doesn't have any anti-ghosting diodes. For example pressing and holding R and then E blocks E for registering. Pressing and holding E then A blocks A. 
- Updated:   Made a little more room in RAM for type update, by re-writing the CBM error codes text to be shorter but mostly as informative. 
- Fixed:     Run command now supported running on any drives. NOTE: The command ./ does not, but that's because it's intended for a different purpose, basically letting you run commands that are small and external as if they were built into the system. BUG: It can only load files from the drive it was loaded from. Running programs from a different drive issue. Also, Exomizer version works inconsistently with loading and running files from within ChiCLI. Not sure why, probably needs some tweaking in the way exomizer is configured in terms of memory layout. I think the fix for one is the fix for both, which is to use the dracopy method for loading external programs. 
- Fixed:     If you set the date and time more than once, it gets screwy. Fix: needed to reset to zero the time offset variable in set_date();
- Fixed:     Displays both Aliases empty and aliases full. Process: start ChiCLI, set datetime, run screensaver, then alias (with none set). Fix was that result, a global var, wasn't being cleared before being used in the alias code. So it was assumed, erroniously, that it would be 0 unless changed by the testing for the alias list being full. This is the problem with global variables, obviously, but in such a limited system, it's faster and makes more sense to use them. 
- Fixed:     Doing the command 'type basic-program' would print out minus signs weird. Turns out, I entered another unicode character instead of a normal keyboard hyphen - character. I made a basic program to barf out every single command so I can check that I'm translating the tokens properly.
- Added:     The alias ss = screensaver to built-in aliases. 
- Fixed:     Command screensaver now respects the currently set text color as well. 
- Fixed:     Command sysinfo wasn't using the current text color. Bug in color-set was fixed, where the global car tracking the current text color is now updated properly. 
- Fixed:     When displaying a Basic file using type, it makes the Basic commands in uppercase, but the screen is in lower case mode, so it should be in lowercase. 
- Fixed:     When displaying a Basic file using type, case 174 : printf("â†‘") wouldn't work, because I'm using a unicode character in the cc65 source code. Fixed with printf("%c", 94 ) instead, which sends the correct PETSCII character. 
- Fixed:     Remaining free disk space is often reported wrong and too small. It needed a long int.
- Fixed:     File sizes reported are sometimes wonky. Was using 1024 instead of 1000 to divide into kilobytes. 
- Fixed:     When exiting to dos, you need to enter NEW before loading anything 
- Fixed:     Need to inform the user when they can't set another alias because all the slots are full
- Fixed:     Setting a background color to red screws up the red part of displaying the Commodore logo on sysinfo.
- Fixed:     Figured out how to make colors and color profiles consistent and retained after calling an external program and returning back into ChiCLI using the -sf option. 
- Optimized: Converted last aliases to built-in, saving migs and megs of RAMs, and freeing up slots for users. There are 8 free now. 
- Added:     Updated readme's with a list of the built-in common aliases.
- Fixed:     Copy path bugs. Now you can do this: --> copy sauce tartar  --> Copies "sauce" in the current folder to another file in the current folder called "tartar" --> copy sauce /tartar --> Copies "sauce" in the current folder to another file in the root folder called "tartar" --> copy sourcedir/sauce targetdir/tartar --> Copies "sauce" in the current folder's folder called sourcedir to the current folder's folder called targetdir named "tartar"
- Updated:   Copy now works with paths. You can now do things like copy * //allfiles/ or copy //somefile //somedir/newfilename! You must end folder with a slash / as it doesn't yet automatically figure out if you mean copy the file to this filename, or copy this file to this folder name using the original implied filename. 
- Added:     The most common alias are built into the system, so they don't take up alias slots. However, there's only 8 now, at least until I squeeze out some more ram. 
- Updated:   The list command takes up one less screenline when displaying.
- Updated:   Tab completion now works when the previous separator is '/' and not just a ' ' space. This means you can type ./somefile and hit tab, and it will complete it something like ./somefilename, which is pretty cool! It also works like this: copy somefile /somed and it would complete it to copy /somedir allowing you to then finish typing copy /somedir/somefile which is also pretty cool!
- Added:     Ability to launch in -skiptitle or -st mode, which skips the hardware screen gets you to the prompt faster. This is also created for external programs that are launched from it and then re-load and re-run it, created a more seamless experience. There are two sample files to test this with: echoarg and lorem. Echoarg just prints whatever you arguments you send it. Lorem just prints out the lorum ipsum text. They both call ChiCLI -sf when they finished so it doesn't appear like you've left the system. 
- Added:     Ability to write current config to the EEPROM of the UIEC 
- Fixed:     When copying files, if thereâ€™s an error, it borks the whole system.
- Fixed:     Pressing RUN/STOP on the bottom line screws the cursor up.
- Fixed:     debug-args: 4 args is supported (should be 5).
- Added:     Now supports setting UIEC devices to hide or show extensions!
- Added:     Added make-dir and remove-dir commands.
- Added:     Also supports tab completion!
- Updated:   Tab completion how hides the cursor until it is finished searching.
- Updated:   Now supports bulk deleting and copying of files!
- Updated:   Added support for drive numbers 8 through 15.

Known Issues:
- Attempting to view the time stamp of files within a SD2IEC mounted disk image show only '0' characters, since .D64 disk images don't support time stamps, even though the SD2IEC does.
- Note: Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: This is a great product! The issues below stem, in part, from the fact that it is creating an Ethernet connection over the IEC serial protocol, and is blazing a new trail. Hopefully I'll be able to work some issues and hopefully document any firmware issues that may exist and pass them along to the developer, Retroswitch.
- Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: The ability to load and run directly from cloud storage, which is device 7, isn't supported yet within ChiCLI. You can, however, do everything normally from Basic first, then run ChiCLI without issues.
- Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: The ability to manage the Flyer settings configuration from within ChiCLI isn't supported yet.
- Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: The ability to mount different disk images from within ChiCLI isn't supported yet.
- Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: The Flyer doesn't seem to maintain the file extensions, such as PRG or SEQ, when files are copied from another device to the Flyer. Everything ends up as PRG. This is an issue with the Flyer firmware I think.
- Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: The Flyer has a configuration for JiffyDOS, but within ChiCLI when using JiffyDOS, the Flyer doesn't work properly. Have to investigate, but I think this is also a FLyer firmware issue.
- Commodore Flyer Internet Modem: The Flyer doesn't appear to support copying a file within a disk image. You copy from another device to it, but the DOS copy command itself doesn't appear to be supported.
- Removed: Tough one: debug-args: When using debug-args, or looking at argv[0] directly, the argv program name loads wrong text, usually something from a printf statement. Itâ€™s as if the storing of text for the printf statements are overwriting the part of memory where the file name is stored. 
Here are some links to help:

Opportunities for Optimization of CPU and RAM Usage (This is old but should be re-visited):
- The list command has lots of room to remove code and printf statements.
- I need to make an entry in this list, every time I think of a place to optimize, so I don't forget and miss some low hanging fruit.
- I've got to go through the code and replace every integer variable with either a signed or unsigned char. This will save a *bunch* of RAM!
- If I re-write the alias code so that I can define the size of the string holding each alias. Right now, there's bug, and when I change the MACRO definition, it borks it up
- I can save a few vars if I clean up the color-set and profile-set code, so it reads and writes directly and only to memory, and looks it up directly from memory when needed. Now that I read it for start-up in -skiptitle mode, I can just tidy up and start using my memory helper macros.
- I should check the string helper actual functions, as I'm sure there are redundancies from merging code I developed separately and then integrated later. 
- I should create a few static strings that I re-use as much as possible, so I'm not wasting RAM with lots of string literals all over the joint. 
- I should figure out where I can ditch printf for conio functions, where possible. 
- Write something that automatically opens and prints a text file, so I don't have to ask the user to enter: "type chicli-readme" but instead it just gets called when they enter: "help". 
- Even more text file based help, and have it search for a certain tag in the text file. Have something like the user enter: "help alias" or "man alias" or "alias -h" or "alias --h" and it pulls up the section of the readme that has the relevant info.

tEXT eNTRY

cHIcli USES CUSTOM ROUTINES TO
MANAGE THE INPUT AND EDITING OF TEXT
ON THE COMMAND LINE. iT AUTOMATICALLY
INSERTS CHARACTERS, AND SUPPORTS 
BACKSPACE AND DELETE. iT ALSO SUPPORTS
CURSOR KEYS AND A HOME AND END KEYS.

tHE cOMMODORE CURSOR KEYS ARE SUPPORTED
AS WELL AS EXTRA KEYS TO MAKE IT EASIER
FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING FROM THE
lINUX OR wINDOWS KEYBOARD LAYOUTS.

nOTE: 
del AND home ARE TREATED THE SAME.

iN ORDER TO ENTER A LEFT ARROW 
CHARACTER, FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU NEED TO 
LOAD A FILE NAME THAT CONTAINS THE 
LEFT ARROW CHARACTER, YOU CAN PRESS:
left arrow 
TO ENTER THIS CHARACTER.

tHE TAB COMPLETION WILL START SEARCHING
THE CURRENT FOLDER FOR FILES WHOSE
BEGINNING MATCH THE LAST STRING OF 
TEXT ENTERED ON THE COMMAND LINE THAT'S
SEPARATED BY AN EMPTY SPACE. 

pLEASE NOTE: i'VE MADE THIS WAY FASTER
NOW. hOWEVER, IF YOU HAVE AN sd2iec 
WITH AN ENORMOUS NUMBER OF FILES, IT'S
GOING TO TAKE TIME TO LOAD EACH FILE 
NAME AND COMPARE IT TO THE TEXT YOU'RE

BEEN RECORDED ON THE fat32 sd CARD.
iF YOU DON'T HAVE A rtc INSTALLED ON
YOUR sd2iec, THEN ANY FILES SAVED
BY THE sd2iec ITSELF WHILE USING A
cOMMODORE 64 WILL NOT HAVE ACCURATE
TIME STAMPS. hOWEVER, ANY FILES SAVED
ON THE sd BY A DEVICE WITH A CLOCK
THAT'S SET CORRECTLY WILL HAVE THE
CORRECT TIME FOR WHEN THE FILE WAS
LAST MODIFIED.

aDDITIONALLY, IF YOUR sd2iec HAS THE
SOFTWARE CLOCK ENABLED, AND THE TIME
AND DATE HAVE BEEN SET SINCE IT WAS
POWERED ON, THEN IT MAY BE POSSIBLE
TO SAVE FILES WITH THE CORRECT TIME
STAMP INFORMATION AS WELL.

pLEASE NOTE, AS OF THE WRITING OF THIS
DOCUMENT, IT IS POSSIBLE YOUR MODERN
COMPUTER OR DEVICE WILL SAVE THE TIME
STAMP INFORMATION IN utc AND THEN
LOCALLY DISPLAY THE TIME STAMPS
CORRECTLY FOR YOUR TIME ZONE. tHE
sd2iec WILL DISPLAY WHATEVER TIME
STAMP IS SAVED ON THE sd CARD, SO
THERE MAY BE A DISCREPANCY BETWEEN
THE SAVED TIME AND WHAT YOU EXPECTED.

aTTEMPTING TO ACCOUNT AND ADJUST FOR
THIS IS BEYOND THE CURRENT SCOPE OF
THIS PROGRAM, SINCE cHIcli HAS MOVED
ALL TIME AND DATE HANDLING TO THE
sd2iec DEVICE EXCLUSIVELY.
